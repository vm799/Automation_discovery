# 🖼️ Neuronal Eye Image Setup

## How to Add Your Image

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Image**
- **Filename**: `neuronal-eye.png`
- **Location**: Place in `assets/` folder (this directory)
- **Recommended Size**: 520x520px (square)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency recommended
- **Background**: Transparent or subtle gradient

### **Step 2: File Structure**
```
Automation_discovery/
├── assets/
│   ├── neuronal-eye.png    ← Your image goes here
│   ├── IMAGE-SETUP.md      ← This file
│   └── README.txt
├── index.html
├── scorecard.html
└── discovery-tool.html
```

### **Step 3: How It Will Display**

Your image will appear in a circular container on the landing page with:

✨ **Visual Effects Applied**:
- Float animation (smoothly moves up and down)
- Neon glow shadow (cyan and purple colors)
- Hover effect (scales slightly larger, pink/cyan glow intensifies)
- Perfectly centered in the circle
- Maintains aspect ratio

### **Step 4: Testing**

1. Place your PNG file in the `assets/` folder
2. Visit `index.html` in your browser
3. Check the landing page - your eye image should appear in the circular container
4. Hover over it to see the interactive effects

### **What Happens If Image Doesn't Load?**

If `neuronal-eye.png` is missing, a beautiful **CSS fallback eye** automatically displays:
- Radial gradient blue eye
- Inset glow effects
- Same float animation
- Same hover effects

**You're never without a visual** - but your custom image will be stunning!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Image not showing?**
1. Check filename exactly matches: `neuronal-eye.png`
2. Verify file is in `assets/` folder (not subdirectory)
3. Check browser console for 404 errors (F12)
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
5. If still missing, CSS fallback eye will display

**Image looks stretched?**
1. Ensure image is square (520x520px)
2. If rectangular, it will scale to fit the circle
3. Use `object-fit: contain` (already applied)

**Image lost on animation?**
1. This shouldn't happen - it's in a fixed circle
2. Check if image has transparent areas being animated
3. Hover effect will show it's working correctly

## 💡 Pro Tips

**To make it perfect:**
1. Image should have transparent background
2. Subject (the eye) should be centered
3. Use high contrast colors (dark background, bright eye)
4. Neuronal/AI theme works best (networks, connections, glow)

**For LinkedIn impact:**
1. Unique, custom image > generic stock photos
2. High quality (crisp, not blurry)
3. Eye theme connects to "insight" and "vision" messaging
4. Neon colors align with "cutting-edge AI" brand

**Once image is in place, you're ready to go live!** 🚀
